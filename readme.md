## Thanks to [Marcus Olsson](https://marcusolsson.me/) for this great solution

Stop polluting your customers footers with a "made by my agency so I put a cheap link in the footer"-link – that footer is your customers property. Instead, if you want credit – add a simple humans.txt.

All this package does is to add a route for `/humans.txt` and the associated view. "*Why would I ever need a package for a simple thing like this?*" you wonder? Well, so did I until I had done it over 20-30 times – it just saves a few minutes which adds up over time.

## Version Compatibility

See [COMPATABILITY.md](COMPATABILITY.md) for full a full compatability chart. Else Composer should be able to figure it out by itself.

## Install

Install via composer:

``` bash
$ composer require rivalex/laravel-humanstxt
```

Since Laravel > 5.5 the service provider will be automatically added. You can also add the service provider to your `app.php` manually:

``` php
'providers' => [
    Rivalex\Humans\ServiceProvider::class
]
```

Publish the view:

``` bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Rivalex\Humans\ServiceProvider"
```

Or by just typing:

``` bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish
```

And selecting `Rivalex\Humans\ServiceProvider`.

## Make it your own

The view is located in your views-folder `/humans/humans.blade.php`.

It's also valid to put this in your `<head>`:

``` html
<link type="text/plain" rel="author" href="http://domain.com/humans.txt" />
```

If you by any chance need to access your `humans.txt` via a named route, that's also possible:

``` html
<link type="text/plain" rel="author" href="{{ route('humans.txt') }}" />
```

## Testing

$ composer test
```

or

``` bash
$ phpunit
```
